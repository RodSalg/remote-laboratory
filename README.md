# Remote Laboratory - PLC Data Acquisition System

## Overview

The **Remote Laboratory** project provides a robust and automated system for **collecting**, **saving**, and **organizing** data from a Siemens PLC via the Snap7 communication protocol.  
The collected data is processed in real time, stored both in text/CSV files, and inserted into a structured **MySQL database** for further analysis.

The system is designed to facilitate experiments in mechatronics and automation laboratories, especially for pattern detection based on pulse trains.

## Features

- 🛠️ Real-time communication with Siemens PLC (S7 family) using **Snap7**.
- 💄 Local storage of pulse trains in **.txt** and **.csv** formats.
- 🧑‍🧬 Automated calculation of **pulse train steps**.
- 🏛️ Insertions and retrievals from a **MySQL database** (`cae_dr` schema).
- 📈 Support for experiment tracking and pulse pattern management.
- 🧹 Automatic versioning of exported files (avoiding data overwriting).
- 🧹 Easy integration with future modules (e.g., machine learning, pattern recognition).

## Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- MySQL Server (tested with MySQL 8.0)
- Python libraries:
  - `snap7`
  - `mysql-connector-python`

Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install python-snap7 mysql-connector-python
```

## How It Works

1. The system **connects to a PLC** using the IP, rack, and slot configurations.
2. It **reads a byte** from a specified DB block and **interprets it bit-by-bit**.
3. Whenever a change is detected, it:
   - Converts the bit array into an **integer step**.
   - Saves the data into a `.txt` and `.csv` file.
   - Inserts the step and timestamp into the database.
4. After collection ends, the **pulse train** is automatically **saved into a summary table** for future analysis.

---

## Usage

### Run the main script

```bash
python collecting_data_opcua_old.py
```

> (You can adapt this command if using another acquisition script.)

---

### Configuration

Inside the code (`collecting_data_opcua_old.py`), you can modify:

- `plc_ip` → PLC IP address (e.g., `"192.168.0.10"`)
- `rack`, `slot` → PLC hardware configuration
- `db_number`, `byte_index` → Memory address to read
- `timeout` → Experiment duration (in seconds)

---

### Database Schema

You need to run the SQL scripts inside the `database-scripts/` folder to create the necessary tables:

- `dadoscoletados2`: stores individual pulse data
- `dadoscoletados_summary`: stores full pulse train patterns

---

## Notes

- The generated `.txt` and `.csv` files are saved with automatic **version control** (`v1`, `v2`, etc.).
- The database connection parameters (host, database, user, password) are configured inside the `RemoteLaboratoryDAO` class.
- This project is modular and ready for expansion (for example: adding OPC UA or Profinet acquisitions).

## .gitignore

All unnecessary files (such as cache, virtual environments, local settings, etc.) are already excluded from Git tracking.
